Hi! I'm Alexandra, pronouns it/she. Currently, I'm an undergraduate student in mathematics and physics at the University of Calgary.

This website is still largely under construction from [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). It may take me a while to update everything. 

A bit more about me: I'm queer and am passionate about Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA). In my freetime, I enjoy working on random projects, ranging from programming to 3D modelling and beyond.
